# Discover Coding

## Services

* One-on-one - A completely customized and personal experience.
* Group sessions - An affordable and effective way to learn in a small group setting.

## Requirements

* A computer - Windows, Mac or Linux
* An internet connection
* Zoom
* The ability to type at least 10-15 words per minute

You will need to install software, but all tools are free and help will be provided getting set up.

## What to Expect

Group sessions are organized into 6-8 week tracks covering different themes. The first few tracks will need to be completed in order (unless the student has equivalent
prior experience). Later tracks will be grouped by difficulty and the tracks in any particular level can be done in any order.

All needed tools will be provided. Ciriculum will consist of zoom lectures, workshops, videos, and lots and lots of links. Homework will be assigned and feedback
will be provided. A small project will be completed by the end of a track.

## What Does it Cost?

Currently this program is early development and no prices are set. I am looking for students who are willing to evaluate the program in exchange for free lessons.
