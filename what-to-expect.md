# What to Expect

Group sessions are organized into 6-8 week tracks covering different themes. The first few tracks will need to be completed in order (unless the student has equivalent
prior experience). Later tracks will be grouped by difficulty and the tracks in any particular level can be done in any order.

All needed tools will be provided. Ciriculum will consist of zoom lectures, workshops, videos, and lots and lots of links. Homework will be assigned and feedback
will be provided. A small project will be completed by the end of a track.
